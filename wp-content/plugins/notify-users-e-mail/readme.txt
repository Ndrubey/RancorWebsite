== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What limit for sending mail? =

The limit is the one who decides your hosting provider, since we use a PHP function pro shooting. They are usually 200 emails per hour.

= I want to change the email sending, like I do? =

Use an SMTP plugin and configure with the data from your email. It is the safest way to use and to avoid blockages or spam boxes.

= What is the real purpose of this plugin? =

Imagine you have 100 people registered on your site and want to notify them of all posts.

This plugin simplifies sending an email with this notice.

== For Developers ==

= Custom email engine/function =

If you don't want to send emails by `wp_mail()` you can do the following way:

	add_filter( 'notify_users_email_use_wp_mail', '__return_false' );

	function custom_email_engine( $emails, $subject, $message ) {
		// custom actions here!
	}

	add_action( 'notify_users_email_custom_mail_engine', 'custom_email_engine', 10, 3 );
